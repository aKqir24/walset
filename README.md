A bash script using the kdialog library to ease the configuration in [pywal16](https://github.com/eylles/pywal16).

> [!important]
> The script may work in the using the normal `pywal` but it may fail to complete some steps of this script, so please use this fork of pywal called [pywal16](https://github.com/eylles/pywal16) in order to complete some steps in the script, also the wallpapers are not uploaded in the repo, so please configure the wallpaper directory first.

## FEATURES
- Gui Dialog configuration along with pywal options.
- Pywal colors to some configurable programs. ( as toml config arrays )
- Uses the pywal16 option to either have a wallpaper in a folder or just an image.
- A wallpaper can be set either to `solid_color` or `image`
- Wallpaper setup options include[ fill, scale, max, fit, etc ]
- Dialog configuration with the --gui option explained below
- Gtk theming based [Flat-Remix-GTK](https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix-GTK) as base theme.
- Icon colors based [Flat-Remix](https://github.com/daniruiz/Flat-Remix) icon pack.
- Reload gtk and icon themes using `xsettingd`.
